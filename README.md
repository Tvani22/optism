Introduction

v  Purpose of the project
We plan to develop an experimental simulation of optical mirrors  for students in optical physics. Via this project, we expect pupils can learn about optical physics in a friendly, interactive environment.  This project will include   variety of mirrors like mirror, concave mirror  and convex mirror and objects.

 v   Scope of the project 
        In Opt-Sim in Mozilla Science Lab, they  developed a project for optical lenses experiment simulation.In this site,they mentioned that  they would like to implement to optical mirrors also to give students the ability to combine lenses and mirrors . So that we plan to implement that part which is the optical mirrors experiment simulation.We plan to develop this project using Html, kineticjs (JavaScript library) and CSS3
